[X] Protect your API Routes with the proper permissions based on user capability
[X] app.get('/schema') should require the superuser capability
[X] app.get(...) should require the read capability
[X] app.post(...) should require the create capability
[X] app.put(...) should require the update capability
[X] app.patch(...) should require the update capability
[X] app.delete(...) should require the delete capability
[X] You will need to create, allocate, and identify user permissions in the model
